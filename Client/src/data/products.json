While practicing at a health club, Patty attracts the attention of June (Aunjanue Ellis) and Fred (John Doman); she's a female boxer and he's a promoter who books fights at local clubs. Both June and Fred think Patty might have what it takes to go pro, and they introduce her to Tommy (James Colby), a trainer who runs a local gym and who helps Patty get into fighting shape. In June, Patty finds a friend who gives her a good reason to get away from her boyfriend, and she begins a slow but steady climb up the ladder of the women's boxing circuit. The Opponent was the first feature for writer and director Eugene Jarecki.",

While doing research for a class project, she makes the terrifying discovery that the madman who killed her friends is back on the loose -- and that his methods and actions bear a striking resemblance to that of Jack the Ripper, the bloodthirsty killer who terrorized London over a century ago.

While there are some instances of directional use in this mix (usually with the gangster rap soundtrack), the bulk of the track tends to come from the center and front speakers only. Also included on this disc is a music-only soundtrack, as well as subtitles in English and Spanish. The extra features on this disc start with an engaging interview with director Larry Clark that sadly lasts only around five minutes. Next up are some fairly long interviews with the young cast discussing their characters and the screenplay. \"How the Actors Landed Their Roles\" is a comedic interview with each cast member joking about how they slept with the director to be in the movie (which, in a roundabout way, is sort of creepy). Finally there's a picture gallery of the real people this movie is based on, and a theatrical trailer for the film.",

This is a very passable 5.1 soundtrack that utilizes surround sounds to some degree (i.e., when music is playing, when there are any fast-paced action scenes onscreen). All aspects of the dialogue, music, and effects are clear of any excessive distortion or hiss. Also included on this disc are English captions. Extra features on this edition of Balto II: Wolf Quest are slim, including a fairly difficult game that lets kids attempt to have Balto rescue his daughter across some ice blocks, a Fisher-Price toy commercial, some DVD-ROM features, and five trailers for some Universal children's movies.",

A live-action intro and outro set the stage for the story of Balto (voiced by Kevin Bacon), a stray who's half dog and half wolf, who is shunned as a half-breed outcast by both humans and his own kind. Balto does have some friends, like the goose Boris (Bob Hoskins) and two polar bears named Muk and Luk (Phil Collins), but he is particularly resented by canine pack leader Steele (Jim Cummings), with whom he is competing for the affections of Jenna (Bridget Fonda). He eventually becomes a hero when he guides a medication-carrying sled to a townful of sick kids in the wilds of Alaska. The film features a number of positive messages (subtlety is not its strong point), but it may not feature enough humor or excitement to keep anyone but the very smallest viewers engrossed.",

The audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 in English and French, as well as DTS in English. Both the Dolby 5.1 and the DTS soundtrack sound very full and expansive. Range on both of these tracks is very good with Surround Sounds utilized during many scenes, especially those containing wartime fighting or Italian music. All aspects of the soundtrack are distortion free and very bombastic. Also included on this disc are closed captions in English.&#13;Captain Corelli's Mandolin contains a few extra features that should please fans. Starting off the disc is an insightful and informative commentary track by director John Madden. While the director sometimes lapses into moments of silence, overall this is a good commentary track with many behind-the-scenes stories and information. Also included on this disc is a music video by opera singer Russell Watson for the song \"Ricordo Ancor,\" some production notes, cast and crew information, a theatrical trailer for the film, and some DVD-ROM features for a PC computer.

No grain, dirt, edge enhancement, or digital artifacting is spotted anywhere on this disc. All of the colors, flesh tones, and black levels look very vibrant and even. The audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround EX, DTS 6.1, and Dolby 2.0 Surround, all in English. The DTS and Dolby 5.1 soundtracks both sound extremely bombastic and full. The surround feature on each of these mixes is utilized extensively through the front and rear speakers to maximum effect. All aspects of the dialogue, effects, and music are clear of any distortion or hiss. Also included on this disc are English subtitles. &#13;Bones is presented in New Line's \"Platinum Edition\" and features lots of goodies for fans to peruse through. The first is a commentary track by director Ernest Dickerson, writer Adam Simon, and star Snoop Dogg. While this is a somewhat dull track with some lulls in the feature, there are some interesting behind-the-scenes tidbits shared with the viewer. Fourteen deleted scenes are next totaling about 24 minutes. Some of these cut scenes are fairly interesting, while others are just boring. Two rather long featurettes titled \"Digging up Bones\" and \"Urban Gothic: Bones and Its Influences,\" are very in-depth looks at both the production of the film as well as where the idea for Bones sprung from. Rounding out the extra features are two music videos, one live and one filmed, by Snoop Dogg, as well as some info on the cast and crew and a theatrical trailer presented in anamorphic widescreen. Watch your back and get your hands on this great edition of Bones.",

    "longDescription": "Twists and turns abound in the David Mamet thriller Heist. Sporting a solid 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer, Warner Bros. has done a nice job making sure this image is clear of any excessive hindrances or imperfections. The colors all look bright and bustling with the black levels spot-on. The audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround in English and French. This Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is mixed very evenly, though it is mainly filtered through the front and center speakers. While this soundtrack may not be as aggressive or bombastic as other action movies, it is engagingly crisp with Mamet's unique brand of dialogue. Also included on this disc are English, French, and Spanish subtitles. Sadly, the only extra features to be found on this disc are a few measly filmographies on the cast and crew, plus a single theatrical trailer for the film.",

    "longDescription": "Hearts in Atlantis, another in a series of films adapted from Stephen King novels, makes a wonderful translation to DVD. The image, which is presented in its original aspect ratio of 1.85:1, and, as would be expected, is anamorphic, is sharp and duplicates the theatrical experience as close as a disc can get. Sound, with a Dolby Digital 5.1 track, is equally impressive, even if it doesn't take advantage of the entire sound spectrum. Dialogue is clear and lacks any distortion, showing excellent audio mastering. The disc also features a soundtrack in French as well as subtitles in English and French. Though not really a special edition, this DVD does contain some fine supplemental materials. Of strong interest is a commentary track from soft spoken director Scott Hicks. He fills the time with valuable anecdotes that enhance the viewing of the film. Of great interest is a 30-minute interview with Anthony Hopkins. He is interviewed by Hicks and both have many insightful comments, not only about this film, but Hopkins' career and his acting style. Finally, there is a brief photo gallery and the theatrical trailer, making this a DVD that stands out in nearly every way.",

This 3.0 soundtrack is quite nice, though not as extensive as a Dolby 5.1 remix. This 3.0 soundtrack has a nice range of fidelity and depth with only a small amount of distortion heard during a few key scenes. Also included on this disc are English closed captions and English, French, Thai, Korean, Chinese, Portuguese, and Spanish subtitles.

Gyllenhaal and director Blair Hayes provide a commentary track as one of the DVD's special features. There is also a \"director's diary\" feature, which has Hayes ruminating during the filming of various scenes. Other extras include a feature on how the bubble suit was designed, a production design gallery, a look at the storyboards of a certain sequence, and a \"bright and shiny\" singalong (watch the movie, it'll make sense). The DVD presents the film in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound and a widescreen version in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio enhanced for 16x9 televisions.",

    "longDescription": "Director Steven Spielberg's A.I.: Artificial Intelligence was not only a box-office disappointment, it also did something that his previous films have rarely or never done -- it alienated the audience and divided the critics. Perhaps with the release of the film onto DVD, Spielberg's misunderstood science fiction fairy tale will find a more receptive audience. Dreamworks Home Entertainment has released the film as a two-disc special edition, in either its preferred letterboxed version (1.85:1 enhanced) or in a pan-and-scan format. The image on the letterboxed version is excellent throughout. The soft smoky interiors of the first part of the film have a nice auburn glow to them, which nicely contrasts the sultry colors that take over for the second part. There is no evidence of color bleeding or flaring up and the image is consistently balanced. Many scenes, which are filmed purposefully dark, still manage to keep a richness and depth that is difficult to replicate outside of a movie theater. The disc also comes equipped with various soundtrack options, including an English language 5.1 track, 2.0 Dolby Surround, and a 5.1 DTS option. The first two tracks are vigorous and active, though always keeping the dialogue clear. The first disc contains the film itself and a short ten-minute documentary on the making and origins of the film. But it's with the second disc that one finds a plethora of supplemental material. The disc contains numerous mini-documentaries on all stages of A.I.'s production, from its initial planning stage with Stanley Kubrick to its final release. There are some nice interviews with actors Jude Law, Haley Joel Osment, and others. Also of interest are the interviews with the storyboard artists, production designers, and the many special effects technicians from Stan Winston's factory of wonders and Lucasfilm's ILM studio. The disc also contains a couple of theatrical trailers, a multitude of storyboard sketches, production photographs, some interesting interviews with sound designer Gary Rydstrom and composer John Williams, and much more.",

    "longDescription": "Yes, it somehow sounds like an exercise in overkill, tracking down a 35mm print of Jerry Warren's ultra-low-budget Teenage Zombies, but that's what Retromedia has done, and the $20 list price for their disc is worth it. As usual with Retromedia's DVDs, one gets the drive-in movie intro- and outro- segments and a sleazy promotional wrap-around, along with a funny intro by Fred Olen Ray. Then comes the movie, which looks better than any picture of its budget ought to look today -- not that there aren't a load of vertical scratches visible, but the definition and detail of the transfer is extraordinary, and far better than this review recalls of fully legitimate, licensed television showings of this picture during the later 1960's; not that there aren't flaws, including white and black lines, missing frames, and abrupt changes in brightness within the same shot. Of course, we're dealing with Touch Of Evil here, in terms of importance or seriousness, but it's nice to have the movie looking and sounding this good -- the higher grade material does allow one to focus on the inadequacy of the acting and directing, which can enhance the unintended comedic value of the film. This disc is superior to the rival Bevery DVD release in every respect, with enough bonus materials to delight the fan of schlock cinema. One highlight is the interview with Katherine Victor, who looks to be in good shape given that the has to be in her 70's; she tells of the shoot on Teenage Zombies and who she came to be involved, and about producer/director Jerry Warren's manner as a director and his career as a producer. Even better is the interview with Chuck Niles, who played Ivan the Zombie, and recalls Warren and the shoot on Teenage Zombies with a certain degree of amused fondness -- he also remembers in greater detail some of the attributes of Warren's directorial style, though he does concede in the course of his talk that he understood the business of movies better than directing them. The trailer also has its own value, as an overheated account of the movie that promises far more excitement than any Warren film could ever have delivered (though the silliness is also emphasized, albeit quietly). The bonuses also include a raft of drive-in theater related recreation, intermission, and refreshment promotion spots. It's all first-rate fun, which is the nicest thing you can possibly say about a movie like Teenage Zombies.",

    "longDescription": "Director Jean Rollin is one of the cinema's true iconoclasts. Even in his home country of France, Rollin is a cult figure at best, if he's even considered at all. But in the rest of Europe and abroad, Rollin has garnered a rabid following that can attest to his wild, idiosyncratic, surreal hybrid horror films of sex and death. He's an acquired taste, but for any lover of Euro-styled horror, he is a must. The Grapes of Death is one of his more commercial productions and has been branded as the first French gore film as well. It also marks the first time the director worked with the beautiful actress Brigitte Lahaie (who was working as a porn star at the time). The film is also notable for its eco-horror plot, and joins other likeminded productions such as Let the Sleeping Corpses Lie, Day of the Animals, The Crazies, and Prophecy. Synapse Films' DVD is superb and will hopefully convert many new fans to the peculiar talents of Rollin. Offered in its proper letterboxed aspect ratio of 1.66:1 (enhanced), the picture is very sharp and stable. Colors are nicely balanced and the image really puts to shame all previous \"gray market\" videotapes. The French language soundtrack (with optional English subtitles) sounds great, and along with the picture, has been given an excellent remastering. The disc also contains a very nice video interview with Rollin and star Lahaie (in English), a couple of original theatrical trailers, a photo slide show, director bio and filmography, and liner notes by genre critic Nigel J. Burrell. There are plenty of Rollin's films on DVD, but this release tops them all. Great stuff.",

    "longDescription": "What's there to say about Federico Fellini's masterpiece that hasn't already been said? It's a classic, no doubt about it. If you've never had the pleasure to see the film before, feast your eyes on the Criterion Collection's two-disc DVD and enjoy the abundant digital goodies contained in it. Disc one contains the film, which has been appropriately letterboxed (1.85:1 enhanced), digitally remastered, and restored. Also included is a screen-specific commentary by film critic Gideon Bachmann and NYU Professor of Film Antonio Monda, an optional video introduction by director Terry Gilliam, who explains why he enjoys the film so much and why it remains his favorite Fellini experience. The transfer is exquisite, nicely showing off the film's beautiful black-and-white cinematography by the great Gianni di Venanzo. The film has never looked better on home video. The commentary track also makes this disc extremely worthwhile, as Bachmann and Monda detail every aspect of the film's production, as well as all of the many thematic, psychological, and personal layers that make the film so intriguing. As with the best commentary tracks, it's entertaining as well as informative. Think of it as a fantastic two-hour film course. Disc two continues the outstanding supplements by containing the 52-minute documentary \"Fellini: A Director's Notebook,\" which was originally made for television. The documentary is part fantasy, part reality, and all Fellini. It makes a great addition to the set. Also included on the disc is a very nice 48-minute documentary about Fellini's frequent collaborator, composer Nino Rota, that no fan should miss. In addition, the disc includes interviews with several names: famed cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, most famous for his work on Apocalypse Now and his stunning collaborations for many of Bernardo Bertolucci's films; actress Sandra Milo, who stars in 8 1/2; and director Lina Wertmuller, who was responsible for many controversial and much-talked about films of the '60s and '70s. The disc also contains a plethora of behind-the-scenes stills and production photos. Liner notes are also included with the set. So if you're thinking of adding a new DVD to your collection or wondering which Fellini film to start with, 8 1/2 makes for both a perfect addition and a worthwhile introduction to one of the supreme masters of the cinema.",

A chapter called \"bonus commentary footage\" includes raw footage of Hawkins cross-legged on the floor answering Gaston's questions about how she got to be so great. Three very polished music videos, a photo gallery of pictures of Hawkins in a meadow, and text bios of the singer and the director are included.

Opening with a view of Hollywood through the lens of an Asian tourist's video camera accompanied by the movie-loving tourist's ramblings, the film cuts to Jefferson City, Tennessee, where two boys indulge in fantasies of fleeing to L.A. Several years later, one of those boys, Dave (Jeremy Jordan), is heading west to join his childhood friend Ethan (Mark Ballou) in Hollywood. Ethan has spent the past five years trying unsuccessfully to finish his untitled film, scraping together a living as an Amway salesman and construction worker. Following his arrival, Dave finds brief work on a porn set before being fired, and, as part of an attempt to help Ethan find funding for his movie, loses his virginity to a lusty Beverly Hills housewife (Ruth de Sosa). Dreamers is directed by Chinese native Ann Lu and features the late, great Paul Bartel in one of his last screen roles.",

    "longDescription": "Presented in anamorphic widescreen with English 5.1 Surround Sound, Unfaithful looks beautiful and sounds crisp and clear. Fox did a great job with all the extras on the disc, providing many more than were expected. The best of the list includes the deleted scene file, which contains an alternate ending to the much-griped-about theatrical version. All deleted scenes are available with or without director Adrian Lyne's commentary, which is very enlightening. Other extras include two screen-specific commentaries: one with Lyne and another with Diane Lane and co-star Olivier Martinez. The director's commentary is much better, as it sounds as if Lane and Martinez recorded their dull-as-dishwater chats in two separate recording studios in two separate time zones. Then there's the behind-the-scenes featurette called \"An Affair to Remember.\" Inside, viewers are given a glimpse into everything from Lyne's love of French films to why Martinez got into show business. The cast interviews feature was surprisingly interesting and well-edited, and the excerpt from The Charlie Rose Show revealed yet another side of actors' lives as well as the history of this film. To round out the disc there is an editing featurette with Anne Coates, hard-to-read director's script notes, and trailers. All of these special features should be enjoyed after watching the entire film first, as Unfaithful does provide a wallop of a plot shift that promises to be ruined if the extras are viewed at the start.",

    "longDescription": "Based on a real-life 1994 scandal involving college basketball point-shaving, Big Shot: Confessions of a Campus Bookie stars David Krumholtz as the title character. Though a mere freshman on the campus of Arizona State University, Benny Silman (Krumholtz) is in charge of accepting all bets for the school's basketball games, under the watchful eye of his mentor, a high-rolling Las Vegas gambler (Nicholas Turturro). It isn't long before Benny is operating his own bookie ring, raking in big bucks at every turn. The beginning of the end for Benny occurs when A.S.U. basketball star Stevin \"Hedake\" Smith (Tory Kittles) suggests that he'd like a piece of the action, too. Although the Benny Silman depicted onscreen remains unrepentant and unapologetic, even when getting his just desserts at the hands of the authorities, the real Silman appears in the film's epilogue, equipped with an unexpected \"Don't let this happen to you!\" admonition. Filmed on location in California and Nevada (not surprisingly, the producers were unable to line up shooting dates in Arizona), the made-for-cable Big Shot: Confessions of a Campus Bookie debuted March 31, 2002 over the FX network.",

After returning to France with his new wife Rodmilla (Anjelica Huston) and her two daughters, he dies of a heart attack. Ten years later, Danielle (Drew Barrymore) is now treated as a servant by the trio. Fortunately, she has an encounter with Prince Henry (Dougray Scott), who is fleeing an arranged marriage. Later, when Danielle poses as a Lady, the Prince takes an interest in her. Inventor-artist Leonardo da Vinci (Patrick Godfrey), accepting the French court's patronage, offers advice to Prince Henry on matters of the heart. George Fenton's music adds an accompaniment to the lush look of this period romance.",

    "longDescription": "Actor-director Forest Whitaker (Waiting to Exhale) helmed this romantic drama about a one-time high-school beauty queen who returns to her hometown of Smithville, Texas. The Steven Rogers screenplay begins in Chicago where blonde Connie (Rosanna Arquette, uncredited) appears on a trashy daytime talk show and tells a nationwide TV audience about her affair with the husband of her best friend, Birdie Pruitt (Sandra Bullock). Walking into the ambush, Birdie is paraded forth for a public humiliation as Connie's claim is confirmed by husband Bill (Michael Pare). Birdie and her young daughter Bernice (Mae Whitman) then move back to Texas to live with Birdie's eccentric mother, Ramona (Gena Rowlands), a taxidermist who has stuffed the house with stuffed animals. Since most of Smithville saw the TV show, embarrassment keeps Birdie sitting around the house in her pajamas. However, her moment of glory as the homecoming \"Queen of Corn\" has not been forgotten by handyman Justin Matisse (Harry Connick Jr.), the first guy who kissed her back in high school, so a romance soon begins. \"Just give hope a chance to float up, and it will,\" says Birdie.",

At the drop of a hat, a competent, responsible professional person can be reduced to a frazzled, bumbling parent, when his or her children become unexpected daytime wards. This is what happens to Jack Taylor (George Clooney) when his ex-wife suddenly decides to elope, leaving their daughter with him. Unhappily for him, his reporting job demands one-hundred-percent commitment as he attempts to link corruption with city hall. The same sort of thing is true in the life of architect Melanie Parker (Michelle Pfeiffer). She must not only somehow prepare a complex multimillion-dollar real-estate development presentation, but must also keep up the pretense that she doesn't have a son because her boss loathes children. When Jack flubs his assignment of getting the two children off on a school day-trip, he and Melanie, who barely know each other, have to take turns caring for the kids. Mishap follows mishap, as the initially antagonistic Jack and Melanie get to know one another.",

    "longDescription": "Damaged Care is fact-based drama about the managed care industry. It originally aired on Showtime. Laura Dern co-produced and stars in the film as Dr. Linda Peeno, who gives up her career after earning a medical degree, so that she can take care of her family. Her husband, Doug (James LeGros), is a successful OB/GYN. In 1987, when their children (from previous marriages) have gotten a little older, Linda decides to return to work, and gets a job as a medical reviewer at Humana Health Care. Patient claims that aren't approved by the UR (utilization review) nurses are forwarded to the doctors on the medical review team, who, Linda learns, are expected to rubber-stamp the UR nurses' decisions. Every decision Linda makes to cover a patient's care is questioned, sometimes angrily. The head of the UR department, Cheryl Griffith (Regina King) befriends Linda, and shares her unhappiness with the system. Linda has a crisis of conscience when she gets a call about an emergency heart transplant that needs immediate approval. Pressured by the company, she finds an out in the employer's healthcare booklet, and denies the claim. The patient dies. Eventually, Linda quits Humana (angering Doug), and Cheryl gets her a job at a smaller, non-profit company, Brothers Managed Care. The system is pretty much the same, though, and Linda comes into conflict with the cost-conscious head of the UR nurses, Gemma Coombs (Michelle Clunie). When a nurse (Suki Kaiser) is stricken with a series of crippling strokes, Linda takes a stand against the company to get her the treatment she needs. Eventually, Dr. Linda Peeno gets out of the system, and becomes an outspoken critic of the abuses of the health care industry. Dern's mother, Diane Ladd, and Adam Arkin also appear in the film.",

    "longDescription": "There are people who like to watch a ball game every once in a while, and then there are baseball fans, individuals of rare dedication whose passion for their favorite team defies conventional logic, and this comedy-drama follows a group of fans whose devotion to their hometown heroes is rarely tainted by the fact they almost never win. It's a typical summer afternoon, and a group of fans are watching the Chicago Bruins play a typically lamentable game from the cheapest seats in the stadium. Decker (Peter Reigert) is the owner of a hardware store who is playing hooky to watch the game. Marvin (Brad Garrett) and Zig (Wayne Knight) are compulsive gamblers who will bet on anything -- even the hapless Bruins. Richie (Hal Sparks) is a loyal Bruins booster who probably knows more about the team than the players do. Melody (Sarain Boylan) is a sexy fan who likes going to the game, getting some sun, and showing off her figure. And Greg (Matt Craven) likes to follow the game, even if he can't see the players -- he's blind. Bleacher Bums was based on a long-running stage play created by Chicago's Organic Theater Company; Joe Mantegna and Dennis Franz were among the actors who wrote and performed the play in its original incarnation, and Stuart Gordon, who went on as a filmmaker, also contributed to the script, as well as directing the premier production. This film adaptation of Bleacher Bums was produced for the Showtime premium cable network, where it premiered in the spring of 2002. Incidentally, in the stage version of Bleacher Bums, the baseball team in question was the Chicago Cubs, but the team and Major League Baseball refused to give the producers of the film permission to mention the Cubs in this adaptation.",

Elizabeth and Tilden's lives are turned upside down when Mother announces that's she's getting married to Nick (Scott Bakula), a man from New York whom they've never met. Nick turns out to be a good and understanding man, but while Elizabeth easily accepts him into the family, Tilden makes no secret of her distrust of her new stepfather. However, Tilden's feelings about Nick take a back seat in the family's list of priorities when Mother discovers she has cancer, and as Elizabeth, and Tilden try to deal with this crisis, they are forced to deal with the intrusive presence of their uncle. What Girls Learns was produced for the Showtime premium cable network, where it first aired on October 14, 2001.",

    "longDescription": "Fans of Hannibal Lecter get more than fava beans and a nice Chianti with Red Dragon from Universal. In this prequel to the blockbuster The Silence of the Lambs, viewers get plenty of in-depth extras about Hollywood's favorite serial killer. Presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen, the picture is clear and crisp. Even during the shadowy scenes, the images come across sharp. The English 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround lives up to the format's reputation, producing static-free dialog and sound effects. Universal created a satisfying selection of extras on this disc, mainly because there's so much attention focused on Dr. Lecter himself. To start, viewers can enter the world of cinema's creepy killer through \"Hannibal Lecter's FBI Case File and Life History,\" a nifty little collection of easy-to-read documents. Star Anthony Hopkins gives viewers an in-depth taste of his relationship to his character in \"Anthony Hopkins: Lecter and Me.\" He discusses how he first met Dr. Lecter: Hopkins' agent sent over the script of The Silence of the Lambs, and Hopkins thought it was a children's movie. \"The Making of Red Dragon\" is the obligatory behind-the-scenes featurette, but Universal created a less commercialized, meatier extra by focusing more on the cast members and characters instead of the typical sales-pitch trailer stuff. For viewers who admire musical genius Danny Elfman, a quasi-hidden musical-score commentary will be much appreciated. The selection of additional scenes, with optional commentary, is a well-organized extra that's worth a look. Here, Universal broke the choices up into three categories: deleted scenes, extended scenes, and alternate versions of scenes. One particularly creepy choice is the \"Attic Scene with Dragon Voice.\" The disc also boasts of a decent audio commentary with Brett Ratner and Ted Tally. The oft-funny banter touches on the origins of the film, the workings of the production team, and the nitty-gritty of filmmaking. Yet perhaps one of the biggest perks of the disc is the featurette \"Inside the Mind of a Serial Killer.\" This Court TV-like feature, hosted by renowned FBI profiler John Douglas, provides insight into the mind of killers like Lecter. Douglas parallels his own experiences with those of the character Will Graham, played by Edward Norton.",

They have a very good time sharing their experiences of making the movie, and teasing leading actor Jeremy Sisto (who is not there with them). The director and some of the production crew have recorded a second commentary. They provide more filmmaking insights than the actors, but are occasionally less entertaining. The internet trailer for the film rounds out this solid release from Lion's Gate that should help the film find a wider audience than it did in theaters.",

Paroled from prison to a boring job, Muller is more interested in a big score, and along with his old cronies robs a crooked gambling joint owned by Rocky Stansyck (Thomas Brown Henry). Although he gets away with the money, some of his men are caught by Stansyck and identify John as the ringleader. On the run from Stansyck's gang, he is mistaken for Dr. Bartok, a psychiatrist also played by Henreid. Curious, Muller goes to the doctor's office, and meets Bartok's secretary and lover, Evelyn Nash (Joan Bennett). Needing to avoid capture, he assumes Bartok's identity, but first must scar his face like the doctor's. Working from a photograph printed from a reversed negative, he applies the scar to the wrong side. Though fooled at first, when Evelyn discovers the truth, she decides to leave, although she is in love with Muller/Bartok. Steve Sekely's Hollow Triumph (aka The Scar) is a film that requires an exceptionally hefty suspension of disbelief in its reliance on coincidence and the literal acceptance of Muller's cynical view of human blindness.",

    "longDescription": "After turning down several other Hollywood producers, playwright William Saroyan sold the film rights of his whimsical Pulitzer Prize-winning play The Time of Your Life to James and William Cagney. The scene is a rundown San Francisco waterfront bar, populated by a group of lovable eccentrics. Joe (James Cagney), a philosophical souse, encourages all around him to indulge in their wildest dreams. Joe's pal Tom (Wayne Morris), a born patsy, runs errands for Joe, the only person who has ever shown him kindness. Kitty (Jeanne Cagney), a streetwalker, willingly allows Joe to sponge drinks off her in exchange for a few nice words. Harry (Paul Draper), an enthusiastic but hopelessly untalented dancer-comedian, is hired by bartender Nick (William Bendix) at Joe's urging. And Kit Carson (James Barton), an addled old man who lives in a dream world, is prodded by Joe into weaving his unlikely reminiscences of the Wild West. It is Kit Carson (James Barton) who solves everyone's problems by eliminating a particularly scabrous detective named Blick (Tom Powers). Time of Your Life was originally filmed with Saroyan's bizarrely humorous ending intact, but the preview audiences reacted negatively, forcing the Cagney brothers to shoot $300,000 worth of retakes. Though many historians have written off The Time of Your Life as a brave failure, the film was actually a hit, grossing $1.5 million.",

    "longDescription": "Byron Haskin's Too Late for Tears (1949) is a lesser-known film noir that has come to DVD is a highly degraded edition from Alpha Video, utilizing a somewhat dark source print whose main virtue is a decent audio track mastered at a healthy volume and a certain consistency throughout, albeit at a low level. Much of the detail is a bit fuzzy, while some of the daylight shots seem to be a little too bright, as though the producers pumped a little too much light into the print -- Dan Duryea's shirt in his first scene is practically whited out of the shot. Additionally, there are some missing frames at a key moment at 34:41, and also at a little over 52 minutes in, and at 56 minutes in. Generally, the image on this disc matches that of the better public-domain videotapes of the mid-'80s, making this disc a kind of peculiar nostalgic experience. There is an absence of details in those same shots, which is frustrating but tolerable, given that the movie never turns up in any particularly better version. The six chapters usual to Alpha's releases are woefully inadequate for the complex plot, involving spousal betrayal, blackmail, assault, and at least two murders. The disc opens automatically to the three-position single-layer menu, which has the \"play\" option in the default position.",

When a new staffer shows up, things start to go haywire -- beginning with the bloody axe-murder of the doctor himself and leading to a total takeover of the asylum by its most dangerous inmates. The acting is horrendous, the sound is incoherent and the color is so cheap-looking that some theaters were issued black-and-white prints... but somehow the intrinsic sleaziness generated by the threadbare production manages to lend it a remarkably suitable ambience. Instead of vanishing into obscurity, this quirky little potboiler became a staple on the early-70's drive-in circuit, thanks to Hallmark Films' frequent double-bill bookings with Wes Craven's Last House on the Left (even borrowing the logline \"Keep telling yourself: It's only a movie...\") and Mario Bava's Bay of Blood. Some video versions are missing most of the graphic violence from the original cut.",

Among the suspects are such low-lifes as Ferdie Fane (Bernard Lee) and Soapy Marks (Alastair Sim), but the identity of The Terror comes as quite a surprise to all concerned (except for those dyed-in-the-wool mystery fans who pegged the villain's identity as the credits unreeled!)",

Roosevelt. Stewart plays Jimmy Haskell, nephew of breakfast-food mogul C. J. Haskell (Charles Winninger). Befriending bandleader Horace Heidt (playing himself) and his orchestra members, Jimmy and his sweetheart Molly McCorkle (Paulette Goddard) tries to persuade C. J. to sponsor Heidt's radio program. The elder Haskell refuses until Jimmy and Molly's landlady mother (Mary Gordon) come up with a sure-fire \"gimmick\" for the program: they'll pick names from the phone book at random, call up those numbers, and give away huge prizes to whomever answers-provided that the call-ees are tuned into Heidt's show. This format worked beautifully for the real Pot O' Gold radio program, but tends to fall flat on screen, despite the energetic musical contributions of Horace Heidt and his entourage (including a very young and astonishingly articulate Art Carney, in his film debut). In England, Pot O' Gold was retitled The Golden Hour.",

    "longDescription": "This is an entertaining package of four Western movies, ranging across 30 years of film production, starting with the United Artists release of William McGann's American Empire (1942), in a somewhat soft, rough 16 mm print with scratches and other flaws, including a somewhat noisy soundtrack. The other three movies are all made-for-television productions from the early to mid-'70s, two of them recut episodes of the modern Western series Cade's County, starring Glenn Ford, and one the made-for-television feature The Hanged Man (1974), starring Steve Forrest. The Marshal of Madrid (1972) looks okay, with fair color and decent focus and detail, and surprisingly few flaws or blemishes, though obviously a proper transfer off of a negative source would yield far greater resolution; Sam Cade (1972), by contrast, is filled with horizontal scratches and suffers from missing frames. The Hanged Man, directed by Michael Caffey, is mastered from a very bright print that also has a fair degree of resolution -- there are some small blemishes and scratches, but overall this presentation looks at least as good as this reviewer remembers the movie from its original prime-time ABC run. The cinematographer, Keith C. Smith, apparently tried for a deliberately archaic look reminiscent of the photographs of the period, which translates well in this mastering. Each movie has been given ten chapters, which are listed on an opening menu for each movie, which must be accessed separately and is a little awkward to use until one gets accustomed to it. In keeping with the pre-1953 or television origins of all four titles, each is presented in a full-screen (1.33:1) aspect ratio.",

    "longDescription": "Lion's Gate Home Entertainment delivers one big wallop of a package for Eli Roth's love-it-or-hate-it splatter epic, Cabin Fever. Forgoing the usual over-hyped two-disc \"special\" editions out there, this lean one disc delivers the all the bloody goods (and then some) for all of you aficionados in DVD-land. As far as extras go, the first thing you have to mention is the five feature-length audio commentaries. Considering how many companies skimped out and just edited together multiple commentary tracks during this time, you have to respect this disc for throwing it all on the line and including all five -- each of which is immensely entertaining. The madness begins with Roth's solo track, which is a doozy! His commentary is never boring and abounds with Tarantino-like references -- the director comes across as exactly the type of hilarious horror geek that the film's hype made him out to be. It's perfect, then, that he's the moderator for the rest of the tracks, including one with the guys in the cast, another with the girls, one that consists of him and members of the crew, and, finally, one just with Boy Meets World star Rider Strong (who, as the DVD put it, talked so much they had to move him to his own track). Amazingly, none of it feels like filler, and with so many moments of brilliance (Roth's call to his old N.Y.U. film professor is genius), the five tracks add to up hours of entertainment for those brave enough for the task. &#13;&#13;If you hop on over to the special features, there's more fun waiting for you, starting with a brand-new cut of the film called the Family Version (great for a laugh or two), while the Chick-Vision feature blocks the image whenever something frightening is about to happen -- a neat (albeit throwaway) idea that more or less just adds another silly bonus to the list of features. For those behind-the-scenes lovers out there, head straight to the \"Beneath the Skin\" documentary. Clocking in at 30 minutes, the featurette contains on-set footage and numerous interviews that show off the relaxed set and detail some of the smaller production elements that weren't covered quite as much in the commentaries (though don't be surprised if there's some overlapping information). The Pancakes special feature shows more of Matthew Helms' outrageous kung fu abilities (further proof that Roth needs to shoot an action flick starring the young blonde one very soon), while the Rotten Fruit section has three segments from the hilarious gore-filled stop-motion series created by Roth and Noah Belson. Technically, picture quality is superb and the disc's 5.1 Dolby Surround track (along with the standard stereo track) is equally fantastic, creating depth in the darkest reaches of the score and atmospheric sound mix. All in all, it's a disc worth shouting about, and one that will keep you busy for a long time to come. Also released in a Limited Edition featuring a holographic slipcover.",

They bring huge dimensionality to your system with a speaker that makes itself heard but barely seen.  The Muro On-Wall speakers are offered in a choice of two colors, white and black.  The front baffles are a painted satin finish, giving the speaker a luxurious look.  The white speakers have a grey grill, so that either speaker will easily compliment an interior design and fit into practically any d&#233;cor.  The OW-V41L has a soft dome tweeter, 2, 4-inch aluminum cone active woofers, and 2, 4-inch aluminum cone passive woofers.  The OW-V41L also has AXIS Tilt Control.  There is a switch on the rear of the speaker that allows for the listening axis to be directed toward the listener based on the orientation and height of where the speaker is mounted.  The result is incredible performance in a small form factor.",

The original mics are still sought after, but they can command upwards of $8000 for a pristine unit, putting them far out of reach for most recordists.  Thankfully, Warm Audio has now changed that scenario with the release of the new WA-67! Based around an EF86 pentode tube and having the same smooth and creamy tone of the original, the WA-67 excels at recording just about anything that you put it in front of, and it may immediately become your go-to choice for vocals, guitars, drum toms and overheads, pianos, brass and strings.",

    "longDescription": "This U.S. release of Don Siegel's Coogan's Bluff is doubly welcome -- for some reason, the movie was available in Australia (of all markets) three years earlier. And except for a short-lived laserdisc release sometime in the '90s, Don Siegel's Coogan's Bluff hasn't been seen in its R-rated version, or in its proper non-anamorphic widescreen aspect ratio, since its original release in 1968. The opening sequence depicting a chase and duel between two armed men on the Arizona desert benefits from the 1.85:1 aspect ratio, but even better are the vistas of New York City that fill the screen at 12-and-a-half minutes in. The whole movie is something of an exercise in visual nostalgia, and not just cultural nostalgia-- the Cloisters and Fort Tryon Park haven't changed too much, but the Pan-Am building is no longer called the Pan-Am building, and they stopped landed choppers on its rooftop heliport about five years later when one of the helicopters cracked up during a seemingly routine maneuver and left some people dead. &#13;&#13;The R rating was the result mostly of the introduction of a virtually nude female dancer and a mostly nude model at the Pigeon-Toed Orange Peel club, inspired by the Electric Circus on St. Marks Place, and the violence of the fight in the pool room, which did help set a new standard for stunt work and movie violence at the time -- all this is back in style, and if some of the blood looks a little fake, the surrounding mayhem doesn't. There are also a lot of faces in here that subsequently became a lot more familiar and some character players who were still recognizable (pinup queen Meg Myles in the small role of Big Red, Tom Tully among other '50s figures, veteran black actor James Edwards as an undercover cop [in an excellent scene with Clint Eastwood and Lee J. Cobb], Louis Zorich as a larcenous cab driver, David Doyle as a sinister pool hall owner, and Albert Popwell and future Byrds member Skip Battin as denizens of the East Village). The 18 chapters break the 95-minute movie down more than adequately and are keyed as much to different locales around the city as they are to various plot elements. The optional subtitles include French, Spanish, and English, and the whole disc opens up automatically on a simple, easy-to-use menu -- the only thing missing is a trailer and maybe an ad or two, which would have told us how the movie was originally sold to the public, and how much of the R rating showed up in theatrical and television spots. Incidentally, the name \"Coogan's Bluff\" has a dual meaning, referring to the plot of this film and Eastwood's character, but it's also referring to a specific location in northern Manhattan in Highbridge Park, near where the old Polo Grounds stood (home of the baseball Giants when they were based in New York), where part of the movie's final chase takes place.",

Built to withstand a fall of up to 1.5 meters or submersion in a meter of water for up to 30 minutes, Beosound Explore is a waterproof and dust resistant speaker that&#8217;s ready to accompany you on any adventure. Whether you're relaxing at the beach or taking in the views on an adrenaline-filled hiking expedition, your Bluetooth speaker can be confidently placed beside you thanks to the non-slip rubberized base. Crafted to be flexible and ultra-portable, it&#8217;s lightweight and easy to carry too. The grab-and-go design is perfect when you're on the move. You can even attach Beosound Explore to the outside of your backpack by hooking the included carabiner to it. The dual 1.8'' full range drivers deliver a huge musical punch and rich bass for such a small speaker. The grill is cut in 360-degree lines, which not only looks great but also helps create True360 omnidirectional sound. You can place your Beosound on a rock behind you, in the middle of a circle of people, or use the strap to hang it from a tent pole and the sound performance will be equally authentic. The elegant and minimalist control panel is on top of the speaker for easy access and the push buttons have been designed to work in all conditions, even if your speaker is covered in sand, water or a dusting of soil. The powerful battery offers up to 27 hours of playtime at a normal listening volume, making it easy to enjoy music when you're exploring in the wilderness or away from easy power sources. You can also stereo pair two Beosound Explore speakers for spacious sound, ideal if you're away with friends or hosting a garden party. No matter where your adventures take you, the uncompromising sound quality of the Beosound Explore will get you there.",

The receiver mounts directly to the USB-C port of your Android Mobile Device, Computer or iPad Pro/Air, providing a digital connection right to the device. It is so compact and lightweight; you can add fully functional wireless system to your Android smartphone or tablet, without any mounting accessories or adding significant weight.

The front camera records a diagonal Wide Viewing Angle of 160&#176; recording in Wide Dynamic Range (WDR) for enhanced imagery under low light or night conditions.  The rear camera records a diagonal viewing angle of 137&#176; recording using High-Definition Range (HDR) technology to achieve higher camera visual recognition performance in both light and dark conditions.  Both front and rear cameras feature a STARVIS back-illuminated CMOS sensor that constantly adjusts the image quality producing bright, richly colored videos and identification-level recordings that capture critical details such as license plates, road signs, and traffic signals.  Additional features include a 2\" LCD display on the front camera/main unit for easy operation, built-in GPS for speed/location/heading/time data acquisition, and Wi-Fi direct connection to the Pioneer \"Dash Camera Interface\" smartphone app to access recorded videos, make manual recordings or photos, download recorded data, or change system settings.  Parking Mode and Security Mode allow event recordings even when parked to give you front and rear protection when your vehicle is out of sight.  If an incident occurs while in Parking Mode, the built-in 3-axis G-Force motion sensor will detect the vibration and automatically capture and save video 20 seconds before and after an incident is detected.",

Copy enemies&#8217; abilities like the new Drill and Ranger and use them to attack, explore your surroundings, and save the kidnapped Waddle Dees from the ferocious Beast Pack alongside the mysterious Elfilin. Hope you&#8217;re hungry for an unforgettable adventure!        Get a mouthful of real-world objects for all-new, powerful transformations        Feeling hungry?

Then, use your boxy body to shoot out cans at baddies. Consume a car to gain some wheels and slam through walls. Sit back and take it all in&#8230;literally.        Join up with a pointy partner, Bandana Waddle Dee, in co-op play        Pass a Joy-Con controller to a buddy to play as the spear-wielding Bandana Waddle Dee and help each other explore and battle through this colorful world.

Float over obstacles and fight through enemies on your way to each stage&#8217;s goal as you slash, poke, freeze, and hammer using Kirby&#8217;s copy abilities. The tough puff is truly put to the test in dynamic boss battles that will keep you dancing about the arena. Choose from two difficulty modes for either a light, breezy adventure or a more challenging experience.        Each themed stage you travel through will hide several friendly Waddle Dees in peril! Save them to grow the home base of your adventure, the once-deserted Waddle Dee Town. The Waddle Dees you rescue will unlock shops, leaderboards*, and the ability to evolve copy abilities to make them stronger.

    "longDescription": "What we need out of a home desk is quite simple. Top surface space and storage space. That's it. This desk from the Beginnings collection keeps it straightforward, while fulfilling all your needs of a home office desk. The top surface of this computer desk with shelving has enough room for your laptop, a cup of pens, a good smelling candle and your motivation (whether that's candy, a photo of your family, or the countdown to quittin' time). Two shelves of open storage beneath the top surface includes one that adjusts in case you need to make room up or down. Choose to store a hefty stack of binders or just enough room for a stapler and notepad. Sometimes we don't want to see all of the office junk that we need to keep, but don't want it on display. This computer desk with storage includes hidden storage behind a door for all of those \"must keep\" items. Finished in a Summer Oak, this wood home office desk is the humble but effective addition to any home office.",

Inside are a Color Reveal Barbie doll, whose full look is hidden behind a cloud-print coating, and four bags with surprises. Remove everything and fill the tube with warm water, then insert the doll and swirl around. The water turns sky blue, and when the doll is pulled out, the features are revealed! Each Barbie doll represents a different pastel color with long, tinsel-streaked hair and a decorated bodice, but the surprises continue&#8230;open the bags to discover a vinyl rain jacket and skirt, vinyl hat or headband, rainboots and a brush. Color-change effects on each doll's eyes and lips add to the surprise and fun. A rare doll comes with a bonus Color Reveal pet kitten! Use the tube to store these and other favorites. Which doll will you reveal? Kids can collect them to mix and match accessories and expand the possibilities! Each sold separately,",

    "longDescription": "After his 1995 breakthrough, Welcome to the Dollhouse, director Todd Solondz was courted by a number of studios to make a big-budget film with top stars. Instead, he chose to make this aggressively dark comedy-drama of perversions and twisted lives. Andy Kornbluth (Jon Lovitz) explodes with anger after rejection in a restaurant from Joy Jordan (Jane Adams), one of a trio of middle-class New Jersey sisters. Joy's sister Trish (Cynthia Stevenson), a housewife with three kids, is married to psychiatrist Bill (Dylan Baker), who counsels the lonely, overweight Allen (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Allen is obsessed with Joy's other sister, the successful poet Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle), all the while ignoring the attentions of his seemingly sweet yet overweight neighbor Kristina (Camryn Manheim). Bill has fantasies of turning an assault rifle on families in a park, masturbates to teen magazine photos, and develops an unhealthy interest in a classmate of his 11-year-old son, Billy (Rufus Read). After a telephone sales job, Joy moves on to substitute teach at an adult education class, where she falls prey to the advances of an insensitive cabdriver, Vlad (Jared Harris). Allen's series of obscene phone calls to Helen come to an end when she challenges him to come next door and carry out his sexual threats. Meanwhile, the sisters' parents, Lenny and Mona Jordan (Ben Gazzara and Louise Lasser), find their marriage collapsing after 40 years. Lenny has sparked the interest of divorc&#233;e Diane Freed (Elizabeth Ashley), but he actually would prefer to be alone. The path to happiness, it seems, is littered with dreams, despair, and abnormalities. Winner of the International Critics' prize at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival, Happiness met with much controversy both in pre-production and upon its release, as chronicled in producer Christine Vachon's book Shooting to Kill.",

    "longDescription": "A plumber looking for love hopes to find romance by impersonating a movie director in this offbeat independent comedy. David Kulovic (Martin Donovan) is a single guy who doesn't have much luck impressing the ladies, a dilemma he attributes to the poor opinion most people have of his trade, plumbing. One day, David is mistaken for a well-known film director, and discovers people, especially women, seem a great deal more friendly toward him when they think he works in the movies. David's case of mistaken identity gives him a brainstorm, and with the help of his pal R.J. (Kevin Carroll), he decides to pass himself off as a struggling independent filmmaker, hoping to meet aspiring actresses at his bogus casting calls. Of course, a filmmaker needs a script, and David swipes one from one of his neighbors, Toni Edelman (Mary-Louise Parker, who is trying to get her own foot in the door of the film business). As it happens, Toni's screenplay happens to be quite good, and soon David's nonexistent project is developing a very real buzz in indie film circles. Seeing this as her big chance at a career in Hollywood, Toni begins coaching David in how to act like a filmmaker in the hopes they can actually get David's phantom picture off the ground. Writer and director John C. Walsh based Pipe Dream in part on his own experiences as he was making his first feature film, Ed's Next Move.",

Rather than bore her with the inanities of everyday life, Calhoun reads from an old, faded notebook containing the sweeping account of a young couple (Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams) whose love affair was tragically put to a halt after their separation in the midst of World War II. Seven years later, the couple was reunited, and, despite having taken radically different paths, they found themselves unable to resist the call of a second chance. The Notebook also features Joan Allen, Sam Shepard, and Kevin Connolly.",

    "longDescription": "Martin Scorsese's brutal character study incisively portrays the true rise and fall and redemption of middleweight boxer Jake La Motta, a violent man in and out of the ring who thrives on his ability (and desire) to take a beating. Opening with the spectacle of the over-the-hill La Motta (Robert De Niro) practicing his 1960s night-club act, the film flashes back to 1940s New York, when Jake's career is on the rise. Despite pressure from the local mobsters, Jake trusts his brother Joey (Joe Pesci) to help him make it to a title bout against Sugar Ray Robinson the honest way; the Mob, however, will not cave in. Jake gets the title bout, and blonde teenage second wife Vickie (Cathy Moriarity), but success does nothing to exorcise his demons, even as he channels his rage into boxing. Alienating Vickie and Joey, and disastrously gaining weight, Jake has destroyed his personal and professional lives by the 1950s. After he hits bottom, however, Jake emerges with a gleam of self-awareness, as he sits rehearsing Marlon Brando's On the Waterfront speech in his dressing room mirror: \"I coulda been a contender, I coulda been somebody.\" Working with a script adapted by Mardik Martin and Paul Schrader from La Motta's memoirs, Scorsese and De Niro sought to make an uncompromising portrait of an unlikable man and his ruthless profession. Eschewing uplifting Rocky-like boxing movie conventions, their Jake is relentlessly cruel and self-destructive; the only peace he can make is with himself. Michael Chapman's stark black-and-white photography creates a documentary/tabloid realism; the production famously shut down so that De Niro could gain 50-plus pounds. Raging Bull opened in late 1980 to raves for its artistry and revulsion for its protagonist; despite eight Oscar nominations, it underperformed at the box office, as audiences increasingly turned away from \"difficult\" films in the late '70s and early '80s. The Academy concurred, passing over Scorsese's work for Best Director and Picture in favor of Robert Redford and Ordinary People, although De Niro won a much-deserved Oscar, as did the film's editor, Thelma Schoonmaker. Oscar or no Oscar, Raging Bull has often been cited as the best American film of the 1980s.",

The story involves 12-year-old Billy Coleman (Joseph Ashton), who lives in the Ozark mountains with his mother, Jenny (Renee Faia), and father, Will (Dave Matthews of the Dave Matthews Band). Billy's grandfather (Dabney Coleman) encourages him to save money to buy a hunting dog. For two years, Billy does odd jobs in order to save the money. When he finally gets enough, he buys two puppies and names them Old Dan and Little Ann. Billy eventually trains them to become hunting dogs and enters the Fall Hunting Competition. Also starring Kris Kristofferson and Ned Beatty. Even though principal photography started in 1999, Where the Red Fern Grows didn't premiere until the 2003 Tribeca Film Festival due to numerous production difficulties and law suits.",

Aware that there's a substantial bounty being offered for the return of the ship's cargo, the freighter's crew begin exploring the Demeter to see what remains, and they discover that the ship's hold includes a large cache of black coffins. However, the real surprise lurks inside the coffins -- a gang of vampires, taking advantage of the darkness of deep space, have taken refuge in the Demeter's payload, and they soon begin attacking those who have discovered them. Can the freighter's crew keep the menace at bay until the ship's orbit takes them into the path of the sun?

Convinced their interracial union would never work out, Patricia believes Thomas would never be able to endure the acrimony that would be heaped upon their marriage. Patricia leaves New England to return to her childhood home in the South, where her grandmother (Ethel Waters) works for rich widow Miss Em (Ethel Barrymore). When Miss Em takes ill, Patricia cares for her. Upon Miss Em's death, it is discovered that she has bequeathed her entire estate to Patricia. Miss Em's family disputes the will because Patricia is black, and a courtroom battle ensues over the estate.",

As prehistoric ferocity and scientific innovation come together to create a creature capable of unimaginable destruction, the peaceful residents of Grant Lake must rely on the skills of a brutish Australian reptile hunter and a rag-tag band of brave souls including the stressed-out local sheriff and the local animal control expert to destroy the creature and once again bring calm to the waters of their lakeside community.",

In order to research the crime novel she's planning, Molly goes on a ride-along in Carl (Reno Wilson) and Mike's patrol car, and she also visits Victoria's workplace at the funeral home. Then, in a meeting with her literary hero, J.C. Small (Susan Sarandon), Molly gets some cynical advice from the famous novelist. Later in the season, Small turns up again when Carl and Mike (Billy Gardell) book her for driving under the influence. As for Mike, he too had some momentous incidents in his life as he took a bullet during a robbery, which led him to contemplate his mortality and choice of profession. Later, he, Carl and Samuel (Nyambi Nyambi) undertake a road trip to Memphis, where they hope to meet Carl's long-estranged mother. In the Season 4 finale, Molly is ecstatic to be accepted into a prestigious writer's workshop, but Mike isn't thrilled about having his wife gone for eight weeks in the summer.",

    "longDescription": "When America's number-one NASCAR speed-demon is issued a direct challenge from a gay, French Formula One racer with a hunger for the top spot and a mean talent for tight-cornering, the race is on to become the number one-man in all of NASCAR in a full-throttle comedy starring Will Ferrell and directed by Anchorman cohort Adam McKay. Ricky Bobby (Ferrell) is a national hero with a \"smokin' hot\" trophy wife, pair of abusively precocious sons, and an endless line of endorsement deals filling his mansion with toys and his driveway with sports cars and Hummers. His racing partner and lifelong friend, Cal Naughton, Jr. (John C. Reilly), never fails to provide him with a hand on the racetrack, frequently performing their trademark \"slingshot\" maneuver to shoot Ricky into first place, leaving Cal in second. While the public loves these buddies (popularly known by the meaningless childhood nicknames they find so exceedingly cool: \"Shake and Bake\"), a wedge comes between the two, as Ricky Bobby's longstanding winning-streak is broken by flamboyant French Formula One driver Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen), robbing Ricky of everything in an instant as the trauma leaves him unable to drive. Ricky's wife takes his fortunes while Cal takes his wife, and now he's back with his mother (Jane Lynch) and long-estranged father (Gary Cole). Things look bad for Ricky, but his father was once a racecar driver himself, and now with the help of a training montage, a live cougar, and the courage to drive without his gleaming-white Wonder Bread endorsement, Ricky might be ready to face the track again. Sony Pictures' unrated, widescreen DVD release includes many scenes not originally seen in the theatrical version interspersed into the film.",

    "longDescription": "The second half of the second season of Rawhide, starring Eric Fleming and Clint Eastwood, has arrived on DVD with fairly good transfers. Parts of some of the black-and-white episodes are grainy, and one suspects that the original materials, if they still exist, might look somewhat better; but whatever was used for the sources is at least very clean and unedited. The chapter markers on each episode correspond to the commercial breaks, as with other Paramount releases; and each disc opens automatically to an easy-to-use menu offering quick access to individual episodes. &#13;&#13;As to the programming itself, this series dates from a time when TV series typically disd 32 episodes a season. And it's clear from the variations in quality that it was difficult for a writing staff, of whatever size, to generate that many first-rate scripts in a season. They compensated by changing the mood from week-to-week, so that some episodes were deadly serious and grim (\"Incident of the Silent Web\"), and occasionally laced in mystery (\"Incident of the Murder Steer\") as well; and others seem amazingly light-hearted (\"Incident of the Last Chance\", which is essentially The Taming of the Shrew carried westward). Audiences enjoyed the escapism inherent in the setting, and the performances are reasonably colorful and accomplished -- Clint Eastwood comes off as amazingly callow in the early seasons of the series, reminiscent in some ways of Michael Landon's character on Bonanza, while Eric Fleming is intensity personified in his most serious scenes, and Paul Brinegar as Wishbone, the drovers' cook, steals most of the scenes that he is in, and Sheb Wooley as Pete Nolan, the scout, steals the rest.",

Jonathan Rhys Meyers is all dash and panache as the star of the historical soap opera, which bursts at the seams with sex, political intrigue, sex, dangerous court liaisons and sex. In the inaugural season, Henry craves a male heir that Queen Katherine of Aragon (Maria Doyle Kennedy) has been unable to deliver (but his mistress Elizabeth has given birth to an illegitimate son). With his interest in Katherine waning, Henry turns his attentions toward a stunning young beauty named Anne Boleyn (Natalie Dormer) and makes overtures to her to become his new mistress. Putting aside affairs of the heart to tend to affairs of state and religion, Henry welcomes his wife's nephew Charles V of Spain to court and dutifully tries to hide his lack of affection for his wife. After denouncing Martin Luther and his upstart theology, Pope Clement christens Henry a defender of the faith. With pressure from Anne to get a divorce, Henry sends the devious and opportunistic Cardinal Wolsey (Sam Neill) to Rome to petition His Excellency. Amid all the political, personal and religious goings-on, the stage is set for a monumental showdown between Henry, Rome, Spain and France, and all those involved do their best to keep their heads.",

    "longDescription": "This reviewer had forgotten just how good the series The Odd Couple looked -- then he saw this four-disc set encompassing the complete Season Three of the program. After decades of cut and badly transferred syndication copies, it was refreshing to see the deep, solid colors of the original negatives finally re-captured. There are no frills or bonus materials on this set, just the 23 episodes, each of which gets a half-dozen chapter-markers. The full-screen (1.33-to-1) image is crisp and bright, and the sound is full and well-balanced. The restoration of sequences that were long cut (to increase the room for commercials in syndication) also restores certain incidental jokes and sight-gags that have been missing since the original network run of the series. The first disc features an annoying super-menu, requiring one to choose the actual disc menu (rather than a selection of CBS Video trailers), but at least the program menu allows one a \"play all\" optionm in addition to individual episode selections.",

    "longDescription": "The death of Ingmar Bergman in 2007 served as a reminder to many film enthusiasts that despite his strong influence on several generations of filmmakers, there has never been an artist in the cinema quite like Bergman in his cool but vivid embrace of the inner emotional landscape and subtle but dramatic images, and the enduring strength of his finest work hasn't been dimmed by the passage of time. Since they opened for business in 1984, The Criterion Collection have released superb editions of several of Bergman's important films for home video collectors, and Ingmar Bergman: Four Masterworks is a box set featuring four of the director's crucial titles -- Smiles Of A Summer Night, The Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries and The Virgin Spring. All four films appear in the same editions as they were released individually by Criterion except for The Seventh Seal, which instead is represented in a bare-bones version without bonus features. (In January 2008, Criterion posted a message on their web site stating that the no-frills version of The Seventh Seal was included with the Four Masterworks set in error, and their standard edition would be included in future shipments.) All four movies have been transferred to disc in their original full-frame aspect ratio of 1.33.1, and all look strong on disc, though The Seventh Seal isn't quite as sharp as the others and the elements for the films show light damage in spots. All four features are presented in their original Swedish with optional English subtitles, though The Virgin Spring also includes an alternate soundtrack subbed into English; the audio for all four films is mastered in Dolby Digital Mono. Smiles Of A Summer Night also includes a conversation between writers Peter Cowie and Jorn Donner (the latter also a friend and colleague of Bergman) as they talk about the film and its importance in the filmmaker's body of work, as well as an introduction to the film Bergman shot for a Swedish television broadcast and the picture's original trailer. Essays by Pauline Kael and John Simon are reprinted in the accompanying booklet. Cowie also appears in the bonus materials for Wild Strawberries, providing an alternate commentary track for the picture and penning an essay included in the booklet; the disc also features a gallery of production stills, and Ingmar Bergman on Life and Work, a 90-minute television interview with Bergman (conducted by Jorn Donner) which touches on both his professional and personal lives. The Virgin Spring includes audio excerpts from an talk Bergman gave to students at the American Film Institute in 1975 that deals with both the art and the practicalities of filmmaking; also featured on the disc are new interviews with cast members Gunnel Lindblom and Birgitta Pettersson, an introduction from filmmaker Ang Lee, and a dry but informative commentary track from film historian Birgitta Steene. The booklet features an essay from Cowie, notes from screenwriter Ulla Isaksson, a letter Bergman wrote to American censors protesting the trimming of the film's rape scene for United States release, and a translation of the Medieval ballad that was the basis of the story. Despite the presence of The Seventh Seal in a less-than-definitive edition, these are four brilliant works from one of the most important filmmakers of the 20th Century, and anyone with a serious interest in the cinema should see them; if you're a cineaste who wants to own these movies, this is a fine and convenient way to fill out your Bergman collection (and all four pictures are also available individually).",

    "shippingCost": "",
    "longDescription": "For years, Monte Hellman's minimalist road movie Two-Lane Blacktop was one of the great cult movies that home video forgot (thanks in part to music licensing issues), but in 1999 Anchor Bay released a fine-looking DVD of the film, and eight years later the Criterion Collection have done them one better with this truly definitive video presentation. Two-Lane Blacktop has been given a fresh transfer to disc for this release, which was supervised and approved by director Hellman; the widescreen transfer is letterboxed at its original aspect ratio of 2.35:1 on conventional televisions and is enhanced for anamorphic playback on 16x9 monitors. The image looks excellent, capturing the film's deep-focus camerawork and naturalistic color balance with seemingly flawless accuracy and the source materials are squeaky clean while still retaining the look of the original film elements. The audio appears in two mixes -- the original monophonic sound track mastered in Dolby Digital Mono, and a remixed surround track in Dolby Digital 5.1, and though the new mix has more depth and presence, the original single-channel track sounds surprisingly lively in this edition. The dialogue is in English, with optional English subtitles but no multiple language options. Disc one of this package includes two optional commentary tracks; Hellman is joined by filmmaker Allison Anders for a entertaining conversation about the making of the picture, working with inexperienced actors, and the story's roots in late '60s car culture, while screenwriter Rudy Wurlitzer and film historian David Meyer team up for a discussion of the film's philosophical underpinnings and the relationships between the enigmatic characters. &#13;&#13;Disc two of this package is devoted to bonus materials, including \"On the Road Again,\" in which Hellman, his daughter, his dog, and a student film crew drive from Los Angeles to Needles, CA (one of Two-Lane Blacktop's locations) as the director talks about the genesis and production of the movie, as well as in-depth interviews conducted by Hellman with actor James Taylor and songwriter Kris Kristofferson. Another featurette features interviews with producer Michael Laughlin and production manager Steven Gaydos as they talk about the nuts and bolts of the picture's production. Archival screen tests with Laurie Bird and James Taylor are also included (both screened public for the first time here), as well as Two-Lane Blacktop's original theatrical trailer and a portfolio of production stills. Finally, gearheads will appreciate a photo essay in which car collector Walt Bailey tracks down and restores one of the 1955 Chevrolets used in the film (it also appeared in another cinematic look at car culture, American Graffiti). A booklet included with the package features a new essay by Kent Jones on Two-Lane Blacktop, an article on the making of the movie which appeared in Rolling Stone in the fall of 1970, a poetic celebration of the picture from Tom Waits, and \"Ten (Sixteen, Actually) Reasons Why I Love Two-Lane Blacktop\" by filmmaker Richard Linklater, in which he beautifully describes it as \"both the last film of the '60s -- even though it came out in '71 -- and the first film of the '70s.\" And finally, a 112-page perfect-bound book contains Rudy Wurlitzer's complete screenplay (which was published in full by Esquire magazine before the film was released). Two-Lane Blacktop is an intelligent and thoughtful mood piece disguised as a drag-racing picture, and it's one of the signature films of its era; it deserves to be seen, and it has never looked better or been celebrated with greater eloquence than in this DVD edition from Criterion.",

    "longDescription": "As originally aired on NBC on Saturday nights between January 1972 and September 1977, the popular drama series Emergency! bore a marked resemblance to the original Dragnet, with its semi-documentary approach to stories, and it's little wonder -- Jack Webb created the program through his Mark VII production shingle, merely two years after Dragnet wrapped. Episodes took place in the City of Angels, and followed the adventures of two collaborating teams of rescue workers: Squad 51 of the Los Angeles County Fire Department's Paramedical Rescue Service, and the ER staff of L.A.'s Rampart General Hospital. Leading the fire department EMS squad were two heroic paramedics, Roy DeSoto (Kevin Tighe) and John Gage (Randolph Mantooth). Episodes interwove suspenseful, tragic, and occasionally comic storylines involving the workers' attempts to save citizens, with a heightened emphasis on helping to free the endangered from precarious positions. This set from Universal offers the entire season-six run of Emergency! (its final season, prior to a string of follow-up telemovies in 1978), with all of the episodes presented chronologically and back to back, as they originally aired. This particular season featured guest turns by then-unknown actresses Linda Gray and Joanna Kerns, fast on their way to television stardom.",

Stanwyck teams up with a pre-\"Love that Bob\" Robert Cummings in 1946's The Bride Wore Boots, a comedy about a bookish man klutzily attempting to win back the love of his horse breeder wife. The drama The Lady Gambles casts Stanwyck as Joan Booth, a troubled woman whose addiction to gambling threatens to destroy her life. 1953's All I Desire enlists Stanwyck as an older stage actress returning to the home and family she left behind a decade prior. Finally, the 1956 drama There's Always Tomorrow reunites Double Indemnity headliners Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray; Stanwyck plays a fashion designer with a very rocky romantic history struggling over her feelings for a married man (MacMurray).",
